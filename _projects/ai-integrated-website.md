## Overview

This ongoing research project focuses on integrating artificial intelligence into learning platforms to enhance self-directed learning experiences. The project aims to create personalized learning pathways using AI algorithms that adapt to individual learning styles and preferences.

## Objectives

- Develop an AI-powered platform that adapts to individual learning styles
- Provide personalized recommendations based on learning patterns
- Support autonomous learning processes through intelligent content curation
- Create adaptive assessments that adjust to learner progress

## Methodology

The project employs a design-based research approach that combines:

- User experience design principles
- Machine learning algorithms for personalization
- Educational psychology frameworks
- Iterative testing and refinement processes

## Current Progress

- Literature review completed on AI in education (âœ“)
- User needs analysis in progress (ðŸ”„)
- Prototype development phase (ðŸ”„)
- Initial user testing planned for Q3 2025

## Expected Impact

The platform is expected to improve learning outcomes for self-directed learners by providing:

- Personalized learning experiences
- Adaptive content delivery
- Real-time feedback and assessment
- Enhanced learner engagement and motivation

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn
