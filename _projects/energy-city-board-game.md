## Overview

The Energy City Board Game is an innovative educational tool designed to teach engineering design principles while aligning with Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). This project combines game-based learning with rigorous educational standards to create an engaging STEM learning experience.

## Objectives

- Create an engaging, hands-on learning experience for engineering design concepts
- Align curriculum with NGSS Engineering Design standards
- Teach sustainability and energy concepts through interactive gameplay
- Develop collaborative problem-solving skills
- Assess student understanding through game-based assessments

## Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay
- **Players**: 3-6 students per game
- **Duration**: 45-60 minutes per session
- **Age Range**: Grades 6-12 (adaptable)
- **Setting**: Future city planning with energy challenges

### Learning Objectives
1. **Engineering Design Process**: Students follow the complete design cycle
2. **Systems Thinking**: Understanding interconnected energy systems
3. **Sustainability**: Balancing economic, environmental, and social factors
4. **Collaboration**: Working in teams to solve complex problems

## NGSS Alignment

### Middle School Standards
- **MS-ETS1-1**: Define criteria and constraints of design problems
- **MS-ETS1-2**: Evaluate competing design solutions
